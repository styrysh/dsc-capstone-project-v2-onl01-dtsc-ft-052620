# Capstone Module 5 Project 

## Introduction
We are using the datasets containing borrowers and their information across the US. Our goal is to determine whether the loan is repaid or the probability of default on a loan. 
 

## Objectives
Narrow down a list of criteria which increase the probability of default the most and perform random forest, xgboost, and decision tree modeling. 


## Employment and interest rate by state

## Recomendation


Tailor the terms and conditions of a loan to a group of states. For each group of states adjust the terms for combinations of annual income, employment length and loan purpose.




## Conclusion

The factors that affected the probability of a loan default the most were annual income, employment length, and whether the purpose of a loan was a home purchase.
